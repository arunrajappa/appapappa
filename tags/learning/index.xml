      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my mentors used to say, &amp;ldquo;Make promises that you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to keep&amp;rdquo;. This is powerful; it implies that once you&amp;rsquo;ve committed to something, you find the ways to make it happen. Many of us think of learning first and then building, learning first and then teaching, learning first and then writing; however, power comes from flipping the playbook: commit to building, writing, or teaching, and then learn whatever it takes to make it happen&amp;hellip; #Learning #Building #Writing #Teaching&lt;/p&gt;</description>
